**The tentative project title:** Exploring Diabetes Risk Factors in the
United States

**The motivation for this project:** Diabetes is a growing public health
challenge in the United States, affecting millions of adults each year.
As Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable, identifying risk factors such
as physical activity, smoking, and blood pressure levels etc can help
guide preventive interventions and health education efforts. Our project
aims to analyze how behavioral factors are associated with diabetes
prevalence using the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) data. Also, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates
diabetes risk based on their health indicators. By the end of this
project, we hope to contribute to the insights into which health
behaviors and demographic characteristics are most predictive of
diabetes risk.

**The intended final products:**  
- A website contains an overview of the project scope, data, approaches,
visualizations, and other results, in a way that is accessible to a
broad audience. Include the full report as a page on the website, so
that readers can find a detailed explanation of your work.  
- A 2-minute screencast presenting the main results and insights and
publish on Youtube.

**The anticipated data sources:**  
Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset  
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv>

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**  
Data cleaning  
Exploratory data analyses  
Statistical analysis  
- Logistic regression to predict odds ratios  
- Predict diabetes from behavioral indicators, and compare different
predictive models  
- Chi-square test / t-test / ANOVA (compare characteristics between
diabetic and non-diabetic groups)

Visualization  
- Scatter plots  
- Bar graph to see distribution trends  
- Box plot  
- Heatmap

**The planned timeline:**  
11/4 ~ 11/9 Finalize topic/ download and clean data  
11/10 ~ 11/15 Exploratory data analysis  
11/16 ~ 11/21 Model development (logistic regression & validation)  
11/22 ~ 11/27 Create a dashboard and website  
11/28 ~ 12/6 Write a report / screencast recording
