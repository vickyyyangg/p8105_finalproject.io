**The tentative project title:** 
Exploring Diabetes Risk Factors in the United States


**The motivation for this project:**
Diabetes is a growing public health challenge in the United States, affecting millions of adults each year. As Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable,  identifying risk factors such as physical activity, smoking, and blood pressure levels etc can help guide preventive interventions and health education efforts. Our project aims to analyze how behavioral factors are associated with diabetes prevalence using the CDC’s  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. Also, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates diabetes risk based on their health indicators. By the end of this project, we hope to contribute to the insights into which health behaviors and demographic characteristics are most predictive of diabetes risk.

  
**The intended final products:**  
- A website contains an overview of the project scope, data, approaches, visualizations, and other results, in a way that is accessible to a broad audience. Include the full report as a page on the website, so that readers can find a detailed explanation of your work.  
- A 2-minute screencast presenting the main results and insights and publish on Youtube.  


**The anticipated data sources:**   
Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**    
1. Data Preparation

- Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and variable type inconsistencies.

- Create derived variables if necessary (BMI categories, activity levels).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summarize descriptive statistics for key variables.

- Explore distributions and relationships between variables related to diabetes status.

3. Statistical Analyses

- Logistic Regression: Estimate odds ratios to identify significant predictors of diabetes.

- Predictive Modeling: Build and compare different models to predict diabetes from behavioral indicators.

- Group Comparisons: Conduct appropriate tests to compare characteristics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups:

  - Chi-square test for categorical variables

  - t-test for two-group mean comparisons

4. Data Visualization

- Scatter plots: Examine relationships between continuous variables.

- Bar graphs: Visualize frequency distributions and categorical comparisons.

- Box plots: Display variable distributions and identify outliers.

- Heatmaps: Visualize correlation structures among predictors.
